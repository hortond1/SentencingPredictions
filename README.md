# SentencingPredictions
This repository is for analysis done on predicting sentence lengths for different crimes
The goal of this project is to first look into the possibility of accurately predicting criminal sentencing decisions using methods such as linear and logistic regression as well as random forest. Secondly, it is to see how the race variables affect the sentencing outcomes. The models will be implemented using R coding in Rstudio and the data is pulled from the United States Sentencing Comission using SAS programming.
